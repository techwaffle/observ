# Introduction

Observ is a library designed to make it easy to configure event logging and MVT testing in React. It consists of components, hooks and configurable event handlers. The goal of this library is to create the best developer experience for adding analytics to your React application.

## What problem does this solve?

Most libraries that handle analytics focus on integrating with a specific vendor. Observ has been designed to be configurable with any source of analytics service (or none at all). This library puts the developer first.

## What do I get with this library?

Out of the box you get:

- Easily configurable components for defining your MVT or A/B tests.
- Useful hooks for sending events like page views.
- Fully configurable event handlers for integrating with existing tools.

If you'd like to learn more about how the library works, have a read of the [Concepts](/docs/concepts) section. If you'd prefer to dive straight in, go to the [Tutorial](/docs/tutorial) to get started quickly.
